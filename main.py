# Variables - A container for a value (string, integer, floater, boolean), a variable behave as if it was the value it contains 

# Always remeber that the variables must have unique names

first_name = "talena"
print(first_name) # When printing a variable don't put it in double or single quotes, this will print the literal name of the variable and not the value

# f-strings - A feature that improves printing and readability. For example:

second_name = "barbosa"
age = "18"
print(f"my second name is {second_name} and i am {age} years old") # By using an f-string we can add multiple variables, making it easier to put values.

nationality = "brazilian"
holiday = "são joão"
print(f"i am {nationality} and my favorite brazilian holiday is {holiday}")
